Are you Thirsty LA?
===================

Get access to aqueduct levels in the Owens Valley.

This application regularly crawls and publishes a set of somewhat *ahem*
crusty web pages found in the dark rescesses of the LADWP domain. These
pages are automatically updated with up-to-the-minute sensor read outs
for various metrics in the Owens Valley aqueduct sytem.

The issue with the data set as published

1. Only the last three days of data is published - a lot of these figures don't change much day to
   day.
2. No visualizations - mostly what we're interested in is change, and a
   visualization is a much more efficient way to impart this knowledge
3. No programmatic access to the underlying data - we should be allowed
   to use this data however we see fit.
